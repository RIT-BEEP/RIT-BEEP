I am a future Software Developer with a strong foundation in Java programming, Data Structures & Algorithms, and full-stack development concepts. As a BCA student, I enjoy building scalable, efficient, and problem-driven software solutions that combine clean backend logic with modern application development tools.

I am particularly interested in Java-based backend systems, DSA-driven problem solving, and cross-platform app development using Flutter. I focus on writing structured, optimized code and continuously improving my system design and algorithmic thinking to prepare for industry-level software engineering roles.
