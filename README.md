🚀 Professional Summary

I am a future Software Developer with a strong foundation in Java programming, Data Structures & Algorithms, and backend development concepts. As a BCA student, I enjoy designing scalable, efficient, and problem-driven software systems that emphasize clean architecture, optimized logic, and real-world usability.

My primary interests include Java-based backend systems, DSA-driven problem solving, and cross-platform application development using Flutter. I focus on writing structured, maintainable code and continuously strengthening my system design and algorithmic thinking to prepare for industry-level software engineering roles.
